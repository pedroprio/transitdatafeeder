# transitdatafeeder
The TransitDataFeeder open source project is an effort to develop and maintain an application that provides a web-based interface for creating and maintaining transit geospatial, schedule, calendar, and fare information in the General Transit Feed Specification.

This repository was forked from the original "Google Transit Data Tool for Small Transit Agencies" project, a collaboration between the IDEA Project team, PEMCCO, SingleMind Consulting and Trillium Solutions, originally available at code.google.com/p/transitdatafeeder.
